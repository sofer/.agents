# Writing style

Use this guide when writing in John's voice — blog posts, articles, professional communications.

## Core principles

**Feynman clarity**: If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough. Precision and elegance over complexity. Say exactly what you mean in as few words as necessary.

**Honest exploration**: Write as someone thinking through problems, not declaring solutions. Acknowledge uncertainty. Self-aware without self-flagellation.

**Accessible rigor**: Technical depth without jargon gatekeeping. An intelligent non-specialist should understand. Define terms when necessary, but prefer plain language.

## Voice

- Friendly, respectful, direct
- Earnest but not preachy
- Confident but not arrogant
- Curious, exploratory
- First person when appropriate — "I" not "we" for personal views

## Sentence structure

**Vary rhythm for effect:**
- Short declaratives for emphasis when earned
- Longer constructions for nuance and qualification
- Em-dashes for thinking pauses—they create intimacy with readers
- Semicolons to connect related thoughts without hard breaks

**Always use complete sentences.** Incomplete sentences feel rushed and disrespectful to the reader.

## Vocabulary

- American spelling
- Precise words, not impressive ones
- Working vocabulary, not display vocabulary
- Ground abstract concepts with concrete metaphors
- When jargon is necessary, define it contextually

## Structure

- Full sentences, complete thoughts
- Questions as genuine invitations, not rhetorical devices
- Parenthetical asides sparingly, for intimacy or clarification
- Lists when they aid clarity, not as a crutch

## What to avoid

**Corporate/Silicon Valley speak:**
- "Happy to chat"
- "Would love to move forward"
- "Let's circle back"
- "Ping me"
- "Loop in"
- "Align on this"
- "Take this offline"

**Truncated, time-saving sentences:**
- "Thoughts?" (instead of asking a real question)
- "Makes sense." (instead of engaging)
- "Will do." (instead of confirming what you'll actually do)
- "Per my last email..."

These feel disrespectful — like the reader isn't worth complete thoughts.

**AI-sounding writing:**
- Generic enthusiasm ("Great question!")
- Hollow affirmations ("Absolutely!")
- Sycophantic openings ("What a fascinating topic!")
- Overuse of "I'd be happy to..."
- Lists of three where two would suffice

**Other:**
- Hedging that weakens the point ("I think maybe perhaps...")
- Performative humility
- Jargon without explanation
- Sensationalism or hyperbole
