# Agent Resources

This directory contains reusable AI agent capabilities following open standards.

## IMPORTANT: Agent-agnostic content

When writing or editing this file, you MUST:

1. Never include references to `CLAUDE.md` - use `AGENTS.md` instead
2. Never include Claude-specific paths (e.g. `claude.ai/code`, `.claude/`)
3. Never include boilerplate such as "This file provides guidance to Claude Code"
4. Never reference specific AI assistants or their providers by name

Remove any such content if it already exists.

## Writing style

- Use British English
- Avoid using emdashes when parentheses or commas will do
- For headers, use sentence case, not title case

## Standards

See [https://agentskills.io/](https://agentskills.io/) and [https://agents.md/](https://agents.md/)
