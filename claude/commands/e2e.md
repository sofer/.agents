# E2E Test Writer

Write an E2E test for the specified feature or component.

## Process

1. Read the feature/component under test to understand actual behavior
2. Read existing E2E tests to match patterns, selectors, and assertion style
3. Check API routes/handlers to verify expected responses — do not guess
4. Write the test following existing conventions exactly
5. Show me the complete test file — do NOT run it yet
6. Wait for my explicit approval before executing
